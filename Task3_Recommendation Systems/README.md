# 🎯 Recommendation System  
_CodSoft Internship – Task 4_

This project is a simple **Recommendation System** that suggests items to users based on their preferences.  
You can easily adapt it to recommend **movies, books, or products** by changing the dataset.

The system supports both:

- 💡 **Content-Based Filtering** – recommends similar items based on item features  
- 👥 **Collaborative Filtering** – recommends items based on user–item interactions (ratings)

---

## 📌 Features

- Load and preprocess user–item data (e.g., movie ratings)
- Implement **content-based recommendations** using:
  - Cosine similarity on item features (genres, description, etc.)
- Implement **collaborative filtering** using:
  - User–item rating matrix
  - Similarity between users or items
- Get **top-N recommendations** for a given user or item
- Clean and modular Python code (easily extendable)

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Libraries (common):**
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn` (for cosine similarity, vectorization)
  - `pickle` (optional, for saving models)
