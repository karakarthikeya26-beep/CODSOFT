# 🤖 Task 1 – Rule-Based Chatbot

This is **Task 1** of my **CodSoft Artificial Intelligence Internship**.  
It’s a simple **rule-based chatbot** created using Python that responds to user inputs through predefined conditions and keywords.

## 🧠 Project Overview
The chatbot runs in the console and answers basic questions such as greetings, AI-related queries, motivational replies, date/time, and more.  
It demonstrates **basic artificial intelligence concepts** like keyword detection and pattern-based responses.
