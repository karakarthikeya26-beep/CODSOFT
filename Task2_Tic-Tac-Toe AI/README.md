# 🎮 Task 2 – Tic-Tac-Toe AI

This is **Task 2** of my **CodSoft Artificial Intelligence Internship**.  
It’s a Python-based **Tic-Tac-Toe game** where the computer uses artificial intelligence (AI) to play optimally against the user.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview
The Tic-Tac-Toe AI uses the **Minimax algorithm**, which allows the computer to think ahead, predict all possible outcomes, and always make the best move.  
As a result, the AI **never loses** — it either wins or forces a draw.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Two-player mode: **Human vs Computer**  
- **Minimax algorithm** ensures the AI always plays optimally  
- Displays the game board after every move  
- Checks automatically for **wins**, **losses**, or **draws**  
- Simple and clean console-based interface (no extra libraries required)

## 💻 How to Run
1. Make sure **Python 3** is installed on your system.  
2. Download or clone this repository.  
3. Open the `Task2_TicTacToe` folder in your terminal or VS Code.  
4. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python tictactoe_ai.py
````

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to play against the computer.
